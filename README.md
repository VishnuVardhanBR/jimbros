My friends and I started going to the gym, but we came across a problem, we couldn't track how far we've come. We needed a tool to track our daily workouts and improvements. This gave me an idea to 
create a website to log our workouts, physique changes, and more, to later view and analyse our progress and see how far we have come.

- Implemented using the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache2, MySQL, PHP)
- Implemented a user login, Daily Activity Logger and Progress Report.
- Hosted on a Google Cloud VM instance
- Extensive use of phpMyAdmin to manage the database
